Question : - What are the various class design guidelines?
Ans :- 
class ClassName
{
	field1
	field2
	. . .
	constructor1
	constructor2
	. . .
	method1
	method2
	. . .
}

Question :- What is a "import static" write a program to show how it is used
Ans :- In Below Program we can use static import or System and Math Class.

package com.divergent.assigment5;

import static java.lang.Math.*;
import static java.lang.System.*;

public class StaticImportUsed {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		out.println("Static Import System");
		out.println(pow(5, 2));
		out.println(sqrt(25));
	}

}

Question :- What is the proper way of naming a package in java, show using an example.
Ans :- <revese order domain name>.<project name>.<forlder name>

package com.divergent.assigment5;

Question :- Why "finalize" method is deprecated?
Ans :- finalize() method is used for garbage collection. but it drawback is that - 
finalize() method execute is not a grarante.
and it replace by cleaner() and hooks.

Question :- Use a static initialization block to show its use.
Ans :- static initialization block is excecute one time at the time of class load, and it only initialized only static variable.

Question :- Use a non-static initialization block to show its use
Ans :- non-static initialization block of code execute at the time of class object call, and use for it initialized instance variable.

Question :- Overloading is compile time or runtime?
Ans :- Compile time.

Question :- Do we need encapsulation for constants?
Ans :- Constants variable is no need of encapsulation because constants are used for all object and class.

Question :- When should the private methods be used in a class?
Ans :- private methods are only in the interface default method not out side of that class and interface.

Question :- Make use of “var” keyword for local variable.
Ans :- Program.

package com.divergent.assigment5;

public class VarKeywordUsed {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		var a = "String";
		var b = 100;
		System.out.println("var a as String : "+a);
		System.out.println("var a as Number : "+b);
	}

}


Question :- What is constructor chaining, write a program to show it.
Ans :- constructor chaining is process in which we can create multiple custructor,one by one initialized only one instance and reference.
In chaining we can used this and super keyword in first line of custructor.

Program : -
package com.divergent.assigment5;

class ChainingClass {
	
	ChainingClass() {
		this("Parameter");
		System.out.println("Default Custructor");
	}

	ChainingClass(String para) {
		System.out.println("Parameterized Custructor");
	}
}

public class ChainingCustructorUsed {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		ChainingClass chainingClass = new ChainingClass();
	}

}

Question :- What are the three ways of initializing instance variables?
Ans :- Initialized instance variable by custructors, instance block.

Question :- What are the different default values assigned to different types of instance variable of a class, prove using a program,
by printing values.
Ans :- Program.

Question :- Write a program to show constructor overloading and method overloading?
Ans :- Program.

Question :- Is Java pass by value or pass by reference, prove using a program?
Ans :- In java pass by value used.
Program.

Question :- What are two benefits of using the Factory methods?
Ans :- Factory methods benefits are - We can not create object with new Keyword .
We can provide limitation in class by singleton method.
